PROPS:
------

Inputs from a component to a Parent

Accessed using {this.props.name}

Props are immutable, i.e. the components cannot modify the props.
All React components are pure functions w.r.t. Props

STATES:
-------

States are mutable, and therefore can be changed
Can only be used with class components and not functions

1) Do not modify the state directly
If a value is assigned to a state directly, the render function is not recalled. i.e. the value of the state changes, but this is not reflected on the UI.
The recommended way to modify the state of an object is to use the setState() function. This will also re-render the UI.

2) State updates may be asynchronous
State changes are asynchronous, therefore the change in state may not happen or reflect instantly.
If the setState has to be done on the basis of a previous stage, then use the previousState() function

3) State updates are merged
State can be changed per individual entity despite being grouped in a constructor or a class.
If only one attribute is changed by setState(), then only that attribute is merged back into the overall larger entity
