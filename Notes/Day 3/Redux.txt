Redux is a state management library for ReactJS

It maintains a store where the states of the elements are maintainted. This store is immutable i.e. any changes being made are creating new objects.

The initial state is defined in the store, and any action being made on the state to change it, will create a new object.

Any action to be performed is sent to the reducers, which are pure JS functions which recieve inputs as a JS object (POJO - Plain Old JavaScript Object). Reducers always return a state after performing an action. If the new state doesn't exist, then the current state itself is returned

PRINCIPLES OF REDUX:
--------------------
1. Single store of truth - only 1 large object tree containing all the states of the elements
2. State is read-only - Immutable states are modified by emitting an action
3. Changes are made with pure functions - Reducers are used to make changes to the state tree
